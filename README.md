# Podcasts for Chrome

«Podcasts» is a chrome extension that lets you add your favorite podcast's RSS-feeds in the pop-up or options context & play them from a player in your new tab.

## Background

«Podcasts» makes it easier to choose and enjoy podcasts from a vast selection by focusing on your top five favorites. This can help you save time & decision-making.

Enjoy your podcasts!

The extension is open source & hosted on GitHub. It is still a bit buggy, but I will update it when I have more time again.
